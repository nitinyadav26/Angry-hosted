✅ Overview of How to Do It
🔹 1. Spin up a Windows Game Instance Per User
Use Windows containers (or virtual machines) to run the game.

Tools:

🧊 Docker on Windows (Hyper-V isolation for GUI apps)

🖥️ Virtual machines (e.g., Proxmox, VMware, or Azure VMs)

🔹 2. Stream the Game to Browser via WebRTC
Use a game streaming server that captures the screen and streams it via WebRTC.

Tools:

🌀 Neko – browser-accessible desktop via WebRTC

🎮 Moonlight + Sunshine – good for low-latency game streaming

📺 Parsec (custom setup) or Rainway SDK (now closed source)

🧠 Custom solution using OBS + WebRTC (complex)

🔹 3. User Authentication & Session Management
Build a web app (Node.js / Python / Django / Flask) to:

Allow login/signup

Spawn a container/VM with game instance

Connect user via WebRTC to that instance

Tear down instance when user disconnects

💡 Detailed Component Breakdown
Component	Role	Tools/Options
Frontend (Web)	UI, user login, video player	React + WebRTC + STUN/TURN setup
Backend API	Auth, session mgmt, game startup	Node.js / Flask / Django
Container/VM	Game execution environment	Docker (Windows), Hyper-V, Proxmox, Azure VMs
Streamer	Streams game via WebRTC	Neko, Sunshine, Moonlight, custom OBS + WebRTC
Session control	Launch/stop game per user	Docker SDK, Azure APIs, REST calls

🚀 Tools to Look Into
Goal	Tools
WebRTC streaming from desktop	Neko, uVNC + WebRTC, Moonlight + Sunshine
Run GUI apps in Windows	Windows Server with Docker, Hyper-V, Azure
Docker GUI streaming	Neko + Xpra (for Linux); limited Windows support
Login & Session Management	Node.js/Express + Socket.IO + JWT
Deploy infra	Kubernetes (advanced), Azure Batch, Terraform

⚠️ Challenges to Be Aware Of
Challenge	Solution
Running Windows GUI apps in container	Use Windows containers (Hyper-V) or full VMs
WebRTC setup & NAT traversal	Use STUN/TURN servers (coturn, Twilio, etc.)
Low latency streaming	Prefer GPU-enabled VMs and optimize WebRTC pipeline
Cost per user	High; needs optimization or usage-based pricing
Security	Sandbox containers properly; don’t expose full OS

🔧 Want a Simple Demo to Start?
If you're just experimenting:

Run a Windows VM locally or on cloud

Install Neko (custom Windows build) or parsec.gg

Run your game inside the VM

Use the browser to connect to the streaming session

This will simulate your final setup at small scale.
